1. if you want to find midpoint of LL, we can use slow and fast pointers such that once
fast pointer reaches end, slow ptr will point to mid element

2. if you want to remove node from last, then we need to traverse the fast pointer those
times first and then start moving both pointers simultaneously one after other. once fast
pointer reaches the last element you can see that slow ptr has to be updated.

3. add 1 to the current number in LL. 123 -> 124. can be done by reversing and by backtracking
